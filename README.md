# on_the_go
digital go board for players to play go on the go

todo: 

1. Add feature to automatically remove dead stones so players don't have to remove them themselves
2. Add a "go library" in the left column that leads to "library mode". In library mode players can't put done stones, but can choose classic go matches to be played out
3. Add a record feature that writes the moves of a match into a txt file which can be chosen to be stored in the library(2)
4. Rewrite certain parts using the tkinter module so program can run smoother
